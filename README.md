The MightyIO-iOS-Pod will provide you with the methods you need to easily interface with the SuperMighty API.  It contains methods to log in, place the SuperMighty Ribbon, and unlock items/features when a SuperMighty purchase is complete.

## Quick Start Guide
1. Add 'MightyIO-iOS-Pod' to your Podfile http://cocoapods.org/?q=mighty: 
``pod 'MightyIO-iOS-Pod', :head``
2. Run Pod install (Refer to CocoaPodâ€™s [Getting Started Guide](http://cocoapods.org/#getstarted) for detailed instructions.)
3. Import Mighty.h in your AppDelegate ``#import <MightyIO-iOS-Pod/Mighty.h>``
4. Add ``[Mighty initWithAuthToken:@"authtoken"];`` to - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions;
5. Place the Super Mighty Ribbon on your home screen using the code ``[[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithCenter:CGPointMake(260, 45) inViewController:self];`` or place the ribbon asset in your home screen as an UIButton and pass it to SuperMighty using ``[[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithIBOutlet:smRibbonOutlet inViewController:self];``.
6. Add the Mighty Delegate to your view controller: ``@interface HomeViewController : UIViewController <MightyDelegate>``
7. In your ViewController add ``[Mighty sharedInstance].mightyDelegate = self;`` to -(void)viewDidLoad;
8. Add the SuperMighty callback function to your ViewController ``- (void)mightyDidRecordSuccessfulTransaction:(SKPaymentTransaction*)transaction;``
9. Inside the didRecordSuccessfulTransaction function place the code to unlock your item.


Installation
-----
1. Install the Mighty to your project from cocopods at: http://cocoapods.org/?q=mighty
2. Import the Mighty to your project: `#import <MightyIO-iOS-Pod/Mighty.h>`
3. Before instantiating Mighty you must first register at http://themighty.io
* Create an account.
* Add a game
* Add an item to your game and set it to be the test item.
4. In your AppDelegate in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions method instantiate the Mighty:
    
    ```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions
    {
        [Mighty initWithAuthToken:@"authtoken"];
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        return YES;
    }
    ```

5. To verify that SuperMighty is running, run your app and a series of messages should log to the console indicating successful login and retrieval a Mighty Item for that game.
6. Place ribbon using the method ``[[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithCenter:CGPointMake(260, 45) inViewController:self];`` or ``[[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithIBOutlet:smRibbonOutlet inViewController:self];``
7. Start testing.

Methods
-----
The Mighty contains public methods that will allow you to:

* Log in
* Process a Mighty Purchase
* Unlock the Mighty Item following a successful purchase

###Init Functions
**+ (Mighty*)sharedInstance;**
An class method that returns a shared instance of the Mighty.

**returns:**

* (Mighty*)sharedInstance - a shared instance of Mighty
___

**+ (Mighty*)initWithAuthToken:(NSString*)token**  
An class method logs into the MightyIO. On login this method will return your game information based on bundleIdentifier as well as the Mighty Item associated with that game.

**param:**

* (NSString*)token - SuperMighty Auth Token.  (Generated on sign up)

**example:**
```objective-c
    - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication*)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary*)launchOptions
    {
        [Mighty initWithAuthToken:@"authtoken"];
        // Override point for customization after application launch.
        return YES;
    }
```
___

**- (void)makeRibbonWithCenter:(CGPoint)center inViewController:(UIViewController*)viewController;**
A method that will place the SuperMighty Ribbon at a specified center point.  Ribbon will only appear when a valid game and item has been created in your SuperMighty Account.  This method will also handle showing/hiding the ribbon based on campaign active state  when deployed to the app store.  While item is in development ribbon should always display when a valid item/game exists.

**params:**

* (CGPoint)center - The center point for placing the ribbon in the view.
* (UIViewController*)viewController - The ViewController presenting the ribbon.

**example:**
```objective-c
    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithCenter:CGPointMake(260, 45) inViewController:self];
    }
```

___

**- (void)makeRibbonWithIBOutlet:(UIButton*)button inViewController:(UIViewController*)viewController;**
This method allows you to manually place the SuperMighty ribbon asset in your view and then pass it to SuperMighty as an UIButton.  SuperMighty will then add a target to it which will launch SuperMighty on control event  UIControlEventTouchUpInside.  This method will also handle showing/hiding the ribbon based on campaign active state  when deployed to the app store.  While item is in development ribbon should always display when a valid item/game exists.

**params:**

* (UIButton*)button - The instance of the button you would like to launch SuperMighty
* (UIViewController*)viewController - The ViewController presenting the ribbon.

**example:**
```objective-c
    - (void)viewDidLoad
    {
        [[Mighty sharedInstance] makeRibbonWithIBOutlet:smRibbonOutlet inViewController:self];
    }
```

###Mighty Delegate Functions
The Mighty Delegate provides the methods allow you to react to MightyIO actions inside your code such as: loading /opening/closing the pop-up shop and completing a purchase.

####Required

**- (void)mightyDidRecordSuccessfulTransaction:(SKPaymentTransaction*)transaction;**
When a player completes a purchase inside of the Mighty Pop-up Shop this delegate function is fired which returns an instance of the player transaction.  Place your code to unlock the item inside of this delegate method.

**params:**

* (SKPaymentTransaction*)transaction - Instance of the completed SKPaymentTransaction created by your player purchasing the MightyItem.

**example:**
```objective-c
- (void)mightyDidRecordSuccessfulTransaction:(SKPaymentTransaction*)transaction
{
    // You code to unlock the In-App Purchase
    // Ideally this would be dynamic so that a new deployment will not be necessary to create a new MightyItem
}
```
___

**- (void)mightyTransactionFailedWithError:(NSError*)error;**
This delegate method can be used to inform the player that their transaction was not able to be processed.

**params:**

* (NSError*)error - The error produced by the failed purchase.

**example:**
```objective-c
- (void)mightyTransactionFailedWithError:(NSError*)error
{
    UIAlertView *purchaseError = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Purchase Error" message:@"There was an error processing their purchase." delegate:self cancelButtonTitle:@"Cancel" otherButtonTitles:nil];
        [purchaseError show];
}
```
___

**- (void)mightyFinishedLoadingWithActiveCampaign:(BOOL)hasCampaign;**
When your game loads the MightyIO runs a check to verify that the a MightyItem exists for a game matching your Bundle Identifier.  This delegate method is fired at this time.

**params:**

* (BOOL)hasCampaign - Returns true if a game and MightyItem matching the current bundle identifier exist.  Returns false if a game with the current bundle identifier is not found or if a MightyItem has not been set up yet.

___

**- (void)mightyModalOpen;**
This delegate method is triggered when a user clicks on the ribbon and opens the Mighty Pop-up Shop.

**example:**
```objective-c
- (void)mightyModalOpen
{
    //Pause game play
}
```

___

**- (void)mightyModalOpen;**
This delegate method is triggered when a player closes the Mighty Pop-up Shop.

**example:**
```objective-c
